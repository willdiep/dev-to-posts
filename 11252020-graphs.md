### Introduction 
Graphs are used to represent data points, or vertices, that are connected by edges. Common applications for graphs are things like maps, where each location is a vertex, and each path, or road, between the locations is an edge. Graphs can be directed (a one-way street) or undirected (a two-way street), as well as weighted or unweighted (think of the length of each street as a potential measurement of weight).

Consider a map of the area where you live. As a graph, we could model bus stops as vertices, with bus routes between stops functioning as the edges.

What about the internet? Web pages can be vertices, and the hyperlinks which connect them are edges.

Real-world relationships modeled as graphs are numerous, making them an essential concept to master.
