### Introduction
One of the most common applications of graph searches is to find the shortest distance between vertices. Finding this distance has a variety of applications such as finding the optimal route to a destination or transferring data in a computer network.

Take a look at the graph below. Finding the shortest path between vertex A and vertex E may seem easy in your brain, but telling a computer how to find it is a bit more complicated.


How efficient is Dijkstra’s algorithm? Let’s break it into different parts:

- Searching through the graph
- Keeping track of distances
Just like breadth-first search and depth-first search, to search through an entire graph, in the worst case, we would go through all of the edges and all of the vertices resulting in a runtime of O(E + V).

For Dijkstra’s, we use a min-heap to keep track of all the distances. Searching through and updating a min-heap with V nodes takes O(log V) because in each layer of the min-heap, we reduce the number of nodes we are looking at by a factor of 2.
