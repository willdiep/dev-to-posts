According to Emojicode.org, ;Emojicode is an open-source, full-blown programming language consisting of emojis" that was developed two years ago. 

Today, we are going to learn the fundamentals on how to get started. Please refer to https://www.emojicode.org/ to get started on the installation.


### The 🏁 Block
Emojicode programs is written with the file extension .emojic or .🍇. Let's name our new file called hello-world.emojic. It will also work if it’s named hello-world.🍇.

Almost all the code in an Emojicode program will live inside a 🏁 block. A block is a collection of code. The 🏁 block indicates all the code that should run when the file is executed.

Within our larger program, we can indicate one or more blocks of code with 🍇 🍉 code blocks:

```
🍇 to indicate the start of the code block
🍉 to indicate the end of the code block
So a basic Emojicode file will have the following structure:
```


### Print

To print in Emojicode, we use the 😀 ❗️ method. Let’s look at an example:

😀 🔤Hello, World!🔤❗️
The code above prints Hello, World! to the terminal.

🔤Hello, World!🔤 is a string (we’ll learn more about strings in the next exercise). It holds the message we want to print to the terminal.
We wrap the thing we want to print with a 😀 at the start and a ❗️ at the end.
