This week we are going to implement the trees data structure in JavaScript.

### Introduction
Trees are wonderful data structures that can model real life hierarchical information, including organizational charts, genealogical trees, computer file systems, HTML elements on a web page (also known as the Document Object Model, or DOM), state diagrams, and more.

A tree is composed of tree nodes. A tree node is a very simple data structure that contains:

Data
A list of children, where each child is itself a tree node
We can add data to and remove data from a tree and traverse it in two different ways:

Depth-first, or
Breadth-first
In this lesson, weâ€™re going to implement the tree node data structure as a class in JavaScript.
