This week we are going to implement the trees data structure in JavaScript.

### Introduction
Trees are wonderful data structures that can model real life hierarchical information, including organizational charts, genealogical trees, computer file systems, HTML elements on a web page (also known as the Document Object Model, or DOM), state diagrams, and more.

A tree is composed of tree nodes. A tree node is a very simple data structure that contains:

Data
- A list of children, where each child is itself a tree node
- We can add data to and remove data from a tree and traverse it in two different ways:

- Depth-first, or
- Breadth-first
In this lesson, we’re going to implement the tree node data structure as a class in JavaScript.

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }
};
```

### Adding a Child
The next task is to add a child to our tree. Each child in our children array has to be an instance of a TreeNode, however we want to allow our user interface to accept adding data in other forms as well.

For instance, if our method to add a child is .addChild(), we want to accommodate calling tree.addChild(3) as well as tree.addChild(new TreeNode(3)).

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }
  addChild(child) {
    if (child instanceof TreeNode) {
      this.children.push(child);
    } else {
      this.children.push(new TreeNode(child));
    }
  }
};
```


### Removing a Child
Like with .addChild(), we want to provide a flexible interface for removing a child from a tree based on either its data or a TreeNode match. For example, if our method to remove a child is .removeChild(), we want to be able to execute the following:

```javascript
const blue = 'blue';
const green = new TreeNode('green');
tree.addChild(blue);         // add data
tree.addChild(green);        // add TreeNode
tree.removeChild('blue');    // remove by data
tree.removeChild(green);    // remove by TreeNode
```

The generic steps to execute in removing a child from a tree are as follows:

```
If target child is an instance of TreeNode,
  Compare target child with each child in the children array
  Update the children array if target child is found
Else 
  Compare target child with each child's data in the children array
  Update the children array if target child is found
If target child is not found in the children array
  Recursively call .removeChild() for each grandchild.
```

Because we implemented the children as an array, we can use the array .filter() method to update children. Like with .addChild(), we can also use instanceof to check if our target child is an instance of a TreeNode.

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(child) {
    if (child instanceof TreeNode) {
      this.children.push(child);
    } else {
      this.children.push(new TreeNode(child));
    }
  }
  removeChild(childToRemove) {
    const length = this.children.length;
    this.children = this.children.filter(child => {
      if (childToRemove instanceof TreeNode) {
        return childToRemove !== child;
      } else {
        return child.data !== childToRemove;
      }
    });
    
    if (length === this.children.length) {
      this.children.forEach(child => child.removeChild(childToRemove));
    }
  }
};
```

### Pretty Print
Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to display the structure of our tree in a captivating visual way? We have provided a helpful method, .print() that will give you a formatted text display of our tree.

For example, a tree with 3 levels starting with root node 15, children 3, 12, 0, and grandchildren 6, 9, 19, 8, 10, 19 is displayed below:

```
15
-- 3
-- -- 6
-- -- 9
-- 12
-- -- 19
-- -- 8
-- 0
-- -- 10
-- -- 19
```

This method takes one parameter, level, which is initialized to 0, to enable printing the entire tree structure from the top to the bottom

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(child) {
    if (child instanceof TreeNode) {
      this.children.push(child);
    } else {
      this.children.push(new TreeNode(child));
    }
  }
  
  removeChild(childToRemove) {
    const length = this.children.length;
    this.children = this.children.filter(child => {
      return childToRemove instanceof TreeNode
      ? child !== childToRemove
      : child.data !== childToRemove;
    });

    if (length === this.children.length) {
      this.children.forEach(child => child.removeChild(childToRemove));
    }
  }

  print(level = 0) {
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < level; i++) {
      result += '-- ';
    }
    console.log(`${result}${this.data}`);
    this.children.forEach(child => child.print(level + 1));
  }
};
```

### Depth-first Tree Traversal

Now that we can add nodes to our tree, the next step is to be able to traverse the tree and display its content. We can do this in one of two ways: depth-first or breadth-first.

Depth-first traversal visits the first child in the children array and that node’s children recursively before visiting its siblings and their children recursively. The algorithm is as follows:

```
For each node
  Display its data
  For each child in children, call itself recursively
```

Based on this tree displayed using .print():

```
15
-- 3
-- -- 6
-- -- 9
-- 12
-- -- 19
-- -- 8
-- 0
-- -- 10
-- -- 19
```

we can traverse it depth-wise to produce this result:

```
15
3
6
9
12
19
8
0
10
19
```

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(child) {
    if (child instanceof TreeNode) {
      this.children.push(child);
    } else {
      this.children.push(new TreeNode(child));
    }
  }
  
  removeChild(childToRemove) {
    const length = this.children.length;
    this.children = this.children.filter(child => {
      return childToRemove instanceof TreeNode
      ? child !== childToRemove
      : child.data !== childToRemove;
    });

    if (length === this.children.length) {
      this.children.forEach(child => child.removeChild(childToRemove));
    }
  }

  print(level = 0) {
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < level; i++) {
      result += '-- ';
    }
    console.log(`${result}${this.data}`);
    this.children.forEach(child => child.print(level + 1));
  }
};
```

### Breadth-first Tree Traversal
On the to the hand,Breadth-first traversal visits each child in the children array starting from the first child before visiting their children and further layers until the bottom level is visited. The algorithm is as follows:

```
Assign an array to contain the current root node
While the array is not empty
  Extract the first tree node from the array
  Display tree node's data
  Append tree node's children to the array
```

Based on this tree displayed using .print():

```
15
-- 3
-- -- 6
-- -- 9
-- 12
-- -- 19
-- -- 8
-- 0
-- -- 10
-- -- 19
```

we can traverse it breadth-wise to produce this result:

```
15
3
12
0
6
9
19
8
10
19
```

```javascrpt
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(child) {
    if (child instanceof TreeNode) {
      this.children.push(child);
    } else {
      this.children.push(new TreeNode(child));
    }
  }
  
  removeChild(childToRemove) {
    const length = this.children.length;
    this.children = this.children.filter(child => {
      return childToRemove instanceof TreeNode
      ? child !== childToRemove
      : child.data !== childToRemove;
    });

    if (length === this.children.length) {
      this.children.forEach(child => child.removeChild(childToRemove));
    }
  }

  print(level = 0) {
    let result = '';
    for (let i = 0; i < level; i++) {
      result += '-- ';
    }
    console.log(`${result}${this.data}`);
    this.children.forEach(child => child.print(level + 1));
  }
  
  depthFirstTraversal() {
    console.log(this.data);
    this.children.forEach(child => child.depthFirstTraversal());
  }
  
  breadthFirstTraversal() {
    let queue = [ this ];
    while (queue.length > 0) {
      const current = queue.shift();
      console.log(current.data);
      queue = queue.concat(current.children);
    }
  }
};
```
