This week we are going to implement the trees data structure in JavaScript.

### Introduction
Trees are wonderful data structures that can model real life hierarchical information, including organizational charts, genealogical trees, computer file systems, HTML elements on a web page (also known as the Document Object Model, or DOM), state diagrams, and more.

A tree is composed of tree nodes. A tree node is a very simple data structure that contains:

Data
- A list of children, where each child is itself a tree node
- We can add data to and remove data from a tree and traverse it in two different ways:

- Depth-first, or
- Breadth-first
In this lesson, weâ€™re going to implement the tree node data structure as a class in JavaScript.

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }
};
```

### Adding a Child
The next task is to add a child to our tree. Each child in our children array has to be an instance of a TreeNode, however we want to allow our user interface to accept adding data in other forms as well.

For instance, if our method to add a child is .addChild(), we want to accommodate calling tree.addChild(3) as well as tree.addChild(new TreeNode(3)).

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }
  addChild(child) {
    if (child instanceof TreeNode) {
      this.children.push(child);
    } else {
      this.children.push(new TreeNode(child));
    }
  }
};
```


### Removing a Child
Like with .addChild(), we want to provide a flexible interface for removing a child from a tree based on either its data or a TreeNode match. For example, if our method to remove a child is .removeChild(), we want to be able to execute the following:

```javascript
const blue = 'blue';
const green = new TreeNode('green');
tree.addChild(blue);         // add data
tree.addChild(green);        // add TreeNode
tree.removeChild('blue');    // remove by data
tree.removeChild(green);    // remove by TreeNode
```

The generic steps to execute in removing a child from a tree are as follows:

```
If target child is an instance of TreeNode,
  Compare target child with each child in the children array
  Update the children array if target child is found
Else 
  Compare target child with each child's data in the children array
  Update the children array if target child is found
If target child is not found in the children array
  Recursively call .removeChild() for each grandchild.
```

Because we implemented the children as an array, we can use the array .filter() method to update children. Like with .addChild(), we can also use instanceof to check if our target child is an instance of a TreeNode.

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.children = [];
  }

  addChild(child) {
    if (child instanceof TreeNode) {
      this.children.push(child);
    } else {
      this.children.push(new TreeNode(child));
    }
  }
  removeChild(childToRemove) {
    const length = this.children.length;
    this.children = this.children.filter(child => {
      if (childToRemove instanceof TreeNode) {
        return childToRemove !== child;
      } else {
        return child.data !== childToRemove;
      }
    });
    
    if (length === this.children.length) {
      this.children.forEach(child => child.removeChild(childToRemove));
    }
  }
};
```
